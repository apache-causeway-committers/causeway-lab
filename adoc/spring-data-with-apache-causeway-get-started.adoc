== Overview

_Apache Causeway_ is a Java framework for creating web applications using 
the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects[Naked Objects] pattern.  

In this tutorial, we'll explore how to use Apache Causeway to generate UI on a Spring Boot based backend. 
For an introduction to Apache Causeway refer to the documents at the official site https://causeway.apache.org[].

NOTE: We use _lombok_ (https://projectlombok.org/[]) annotations through out this tutorial.
If you are not familiar with these yet, just ignore them as these are optional anyway.

== Setup

Let's start by adding Maven dependencies similar to a standard Spring Boot application:

[source,xml]
----
<parent>
    <groupId>org.apache.causeway.app</groupId>
    <artifactId>causeway-app-starter-parent</artifactId>
    <version>2.0.0-xxx</version>
    <relativePath/>
</parent>
----

NOTE: Lookup the latest available release version from Maven Central

== Backend Service

We'll use an Employee entity with `firstName` and `lastName` properties to perform CRUD operations on it:

[source,java]
----
@Entity
public class Employee {
 
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue
    private Long id;
 
    private String firstName;
    private String lastName;
}
----	

Here's the simple, corresponding Spring Data repository â€“ to manage the CRUD operations:

[source,java]
----
public interface EmployeeRepository extends JpaRepository<Employee, Long> {
    
}
----

Let's pre-populate the DB with a few sample Employees:

[source,java]
----
@Bean
public CommandLineRunner loadData(EmployeeRepository repository) {
    return (args) -> {
        repository.save(new Employee("Bill", "Gates"));
        repository.save(new Employee("Mark", "Zuckerberg"));
        repository.save(new Employee("Sundar", "Pichai"));
        repository.save(new Employee("Jeff", "Bezos"));
    };
}
----

== Apache Causeway UI

=== View Model to manage Employee instances

The `EmployeeManager` class is meant to represent a web page, to be rendered by Apache Causeway' UI logic.

We want this page to show a collection of all the Employees that are persisted in our `EmployeeRepository`.

[source,java]
----
public class EmployeeManager {

    @Inject private EmployeeRepository employeeRepo;

    public List<Employee> getAllEmployees(){
        return employeeRepo.findAll();
    }
}
----

=== Mixin to add new Employees

We can now extend our `EmployeeManager` above with new functionality. Let's add business logic that 
creates a new `Employee`. 

We do this by introducing a new class, a so called *Mixin*. This involves some naming convention, 
for both the class and its main method `act`.

[source,java]
----
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class EmployeeManager_newEmployee {

    @Inject private EmployeeRepository employeeRepo;
    
    private final EmployeeManager holder;
    
    public EmployeeManager act(String firstName, String lastName) {
        Employee newEmployee = new Employee(firstName, lastName); 
        employeeRepo.save(newEmployee);
        return holder;
    }
}
----

=== Menu

We need one more class to tell the Apache Causeway UI logic which *Actions* we want it to render in the top menu. 
With this tutorial we only have one.
As we'll see later, we map the `employeeManager()` method to a menu entry named `Employee Manager`.

[source,java]
----
@RequiredArgsConstructor(onConstructor_ = { @Inject })
public class EmployeeMenu {

    final FactoryService factoryService;

    public EmployeeManager employeeManager(){
        return factoryService.viewModel(EmployeeManager.class);
    }
}
----

=== Wiring the Components Together

[source,java]
----
@SpringBootApplication
@Import({
    CausewayModuleCoreRuntimeServices.class, // Apache Causeway Runtime
    CausewayModuleJpaEclipselink.class, // EclipseLink as JPA provider for Spring Data 
    CausewayModuleExtModelAnnotation.class, // @Model support
    CausewayModuleViewerWicketViewer.class, // UI (Wicket Viewer)
    CausewayModuleSecurityBypass.class // Security (Bypass, grants all access)
})
public class Application {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(Application.class);
    }

    @Bean 
    public CommandLineRunner loadData(EmployeeRepository repository) { // <.>
        return (args) -> {
            repository.save(new Employee("Bill", "Gates"));
            repository.save(new Employee("Mark", "Zuckerberg"));
            repository.save(new Employee("Sundar", "Pichai"));
            repository.save(new Employee("Jeff", "Bezos"));
        };
    }
}
----

<.> Initializes the repository (database) with some values on startup.

[WARNING]
====
some TODOs here 
  
  more details on pom.xml
  application.yml
  we left out Apache Causeway specific annotations above, but need to add and explain these here

== Conclusion

In this article, we wrote a CRUD UI application using *Spring Data JPA* for persistence 
and *Apache Causeway* for presentation.

The code is available on
